# Log Everything

You are data.

## Why

Every second, you are generating data.

When you google, you are generating data.
When you turn on and off your Philips Hue lights, you are generating data.
When you breathe, you are generating data.
When your heart beats, you are generating data.

You can't stop generating data, you just don't bother catch it.

Why not collect all of them, analyze and better understand your self.
